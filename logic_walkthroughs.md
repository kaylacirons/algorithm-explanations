## Algorithm: Linear Search

**Purpose**
Finds the index of a target value in a list.

**Step-by-Step Logic**
1. Loop through each element in the list.
2. Compare the current element to the target.
3. If a match is found, return the index.
4. If no match is found after the loop, return -1.

**Time Complexity**
- O(n), where n is the number of elements.

## Algorithm: Factorial

**Purpose**
Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.

**Step-by-Step Logic**
1. Initialize result to 1.
2. Multiply result by each number from 1 to n.
3. Return the final result.

**Time Complexity**
- O(n)

## Algorithm: Count Occurrences

**Purpose**
Counts how many times each item appears in a list.

**Step-by-Step Logic**
1. Create an empty dictionary.
2. Iterate through the list.
3. If the item exists in the dictionary, increment its count.
4. Otherwise, add the item with a count of 1.

**Time Complexity**
- O(n)
